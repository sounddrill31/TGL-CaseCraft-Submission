## Internal Doc 1: Initial Planning/Random stuff go XD

## Project EdObserver Studio

### Actionables:
- Break down requirements
    - Ask Doubts
    - Make Notes
- Understand requirements for dashboard
- Figure out Project Arch.
- MVP local deployment

### Questions/Train of Thought: 
- How does this integrate with rest of the CRM/ERP software?
- EdTech -> How to justify itself???
    - I see 
- Is the proposed model useful? `Answer that comes to me: Well, kinda.`
    - Career focused courses -> How many enrolled?
    - Learning companions -> Do people actually use them? For how long? 
    - Learner satisfaction -> actual metrics beyond a 5-star
 
- Should Unlox expand into physical training centres to complement its digital ecosystem within the next 12-24 months?
    - If **yes**, what geographic focus, domain prioritization, and organizational safeguards should guide the expansion?
        - Expanding into physical centres would require simultaneously managing:
          1. Digital platforms
          2. 2-5+ Physical Location
          3. Each with distinct operational needs
          4. Staff coordination requirements
          5. Performance tracking demands
    - If **no**, what alternative strategies should Unlox pursue to remain competitive in an increasingly hybrid market?
- This decision is complicated by Unlox's current operational constraints.
- Without integrated real-time visibility into business performance and the ability to rapidly make cross-functional decisions, leadership would face significant coordination
challenges, delayed tracking of centre profitability, difficulty allocating resources, and potential service quality degradation across both channels

### Random Notes:
- Also balance new ideas and culture-fit. 
    - New ideas: Minimal
    - Unlox likes to be showy when it comes to public facing stuff. 
        - (Their website for example is full of animations which don't really look good on a bad internet connection when the JS/CSS is not fully loaded)
        - This needs to be simple, efficient, tasteful and most importantly, BORING!
        - Needs to do one damn job, and do it well! Employees with bags under their eyes don't care about a looker studio alternative, they care about a simple metric that they can embed into their presentations easily!


### Important KPIs, Requirements, Technical Non-Negotiables:


### Presentation Setup:
- Perplexity Pro for initial presentation
- Slidev with custom CSS, proper presentation based on info here and on the sheet!
